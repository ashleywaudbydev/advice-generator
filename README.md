## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workfloW
- Javascript
- CSS Variables


### What I learned

I learnt and re in forced my learning of interacting with a API  and just got more use the syntax on how to make a request and what to do with the recieved data.

To begin with i couldnt understand why on every execution i was getting multiple advices in the DOM, I soon realised instead of using innerHTML  i had to go with textContent and that fixed the issue i was having.



```js
async function getData() {
    const res= await fetch('https://api.adviceslip.com/advice');
    const data = await res.json();
    console.log(data)
    //-----DYNAMIC DATA FOR THE ID-----\\
    const adviceId = data.slip.id;
    id.textContent = `ADVICE #${adviceId}`;
    //-----DYNAMIC DATA FOR THE ADVICE-----\\
    const adviceMessage = data.slip.advice;
    advice.textContent = `${adviceMessage}`;
    //-----DATA ADDED TO THE DOM-----\\
    document.body.appendChild(div)
}

```
### Continued development

I will continue to build on a regular basis focussing most of my efforet on working with api to do more complex things with the data i get back and just see how far i can go with it in general.

### Useful resources

- I referd to my coursework i have done on the brad traversy Javascript course for reference.
